			'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem<br />

			Now the old king is dead, long live the king<br />
			One minute, I held the key<br />
			Next the walls were closed on me<br />
			And I discovered that my castles stand<br />
			Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand<br />
			<br />
			I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'<br />
			Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'<br />
			Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br />
			My missionaries in a foreign field<br />
			For some reason, I can't explain<br />
			Once you'd gone, there was never, never an honest word<br />
			And that was when I ruled the world<br />
			<br />
			It was a wicked and wild wind<br />
			Blew down the doors to let me in<br />
			Shattered windows and the sound of drums<br />
			People couldn't believe what I'd become<br />
			Revolutionaries wait<br />
			For my head on a silver plate<br />
			Just a puppet on a lonely string<br />
			Aw, who would ever wanna be king?<br />
			<br />
			I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'<br />
			Roman Cavalry choirs are singing<br />
			Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br />
			My missionaries in a foreign field<br />
			For some reason, I can't explain<br />
			I know Saint Peter won't call my name<br />
			Never an honest word<br />
			But that was when I ruled the world<br />
			<br />
			Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br />
			Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br />
